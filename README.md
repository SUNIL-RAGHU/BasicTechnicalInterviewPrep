# Sorting Algorithms

## List of Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description | Best-case Time Complexity | Average-case Time Complexity | Worst-case Time Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bubble Sort | Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. | O(n) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) |
| Selection Sort | Finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and places it at the beginning. | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) |
| Insertion Sort | Builds the final sorted array one element at a time. |  O(n) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) |
| Quick Sort | Picks a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot element. | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n^2) |
| Merge Sort | Divides the array into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them. | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) |


# C# Data Structures

# Stack
 A stack is a collection of elements that supports two main operations: push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes and returns the element at the top of the stack. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) ordering principle applies to stacks.

# Queue
 A queue is a collection of elements that supports two main operations: enqueue, which adds an element to the back of the queue, and dequeue, which removes and returns the element at the front of the queue. The first-in, first-out (FIFO) ordering principle applies to queues.

# Linked List
   A linked list is a collection of elements, each of which contains a reference to the next element in the list. Each element is called a node, and contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list.
   
   | Data Structure | Function | Time Complexity |

|  | pop() | O(1) |
|  | peek() | O(1) |
|  | count() | O(1) |
| Queue | Enqueue(T item) | O(1) |
|  | Dequeue() | O(1) |
|  | Peek() | O(1) |
|  | Count | O(1) |
| LinkedList | AddFirst(T item) | O(1) |
|  | AddLast(T item) | O(1) |
|  | Insert(int index, T item) | O(n) |
|  | RemoveFirst() | O(1) |
|  | RemoveLast() | O(1) |
|  | RemoveAt(int index) | O(n) |
|  | Contains(T item) | O(n) |
|  | this[int index] | O(n) |
|  | Cycle() | O(n) |
|  | Clear() | O(1) |
| StackUsingQueue | push(T item) | O(1) |
|  | pop() | O(n) |
|  | peek() | O(n) |
|  | count() | O(1) |
| QueueusingStack | Enqueue(T item) | O(1) |
